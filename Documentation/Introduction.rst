Introduction
============

Cicada contains the libraries describing the objects generated by the [Katydid](https://github/project8/katydid) processing.
These objects should be contained in [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/root-files) files: as such they inherit from the [TObject](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTObject.html) class (the "mother of all ROOT objects").
Their nature should be very close to [TTree](https://root.cern.ch/root-trees) objects.
