Introduction
============

Cicada contains the libraries describing the objects generated by the `Katydid`_ processing.
These objects should be contained in `ROOT`_ files: as such they inherit from the `TObject`_ class (the "mother of all ROOT objects").
Their nature should be very close to `TTree`_ objects.
